# Introduction
This project is to build a web application dedicated to helping users find partners to exercise together. The user needs to log in to the system with a google account. After logging in, the first step is to edit personal information. After the user finishes editing his personal information, he/she can then start to use other functions, such as exercise schedule function, friends function, and search Sports partner function.
